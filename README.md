# Laxus and Thiosymbion

(Developer: Gabriela Fabiola Paredes Rojas)

![Responsice Mockup](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_mockup.png)

Symbiosis is defined as "the living together of differently named organisms" (de Bary, 1879). This website provides information on an extraordinary symbiotic example, the one involving the free-living marine nematode *Laxus oneistus* and its inseparable bacterial partner, *Candidatus* Thiosymbion oneisti. 

+ Throughout this documentation, they will be referred as *Laxus* and Thiosymbion. respectively.

+ The site can be accessed via this [link](https://paredesgab.github.io/PP1-project-portfolio-1/)

## Project Goals

### User Goals

+ Find clear, fun and engaging information about this marine symbiosis.
+ Understand or learn about the unique relationship between *Laxus* and Thiosymbion. 
+ Explore the "cool factor" of symbiosis through this example.
+ Leave with a new appreciation for the surprising, complex relationships that exist even in the smallest corners of the ocean.

### Business Owner Goals

+ My primary goal is **science communication**. Namely:

  + Inform, raise awareness and public outreach about the existance of this fascinating but little-known nematode-bacterium symbiosis.  
  + Communicate key scientific findings of the *Laxus*-Thiosymbion partnership in a simple way.

+ In addition:
  + Spark interest in further scientific study of this fascinating symbiotic system. 
  + Generate public engagement to build a network of people excited about marine symbioses.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
